# Presentation :

### NORTHWIND :
The Northwind database is an example of a database used by Microsoft to illustrate the features of some of its products, including SQL Server and Microsoft Access. The database contains sales data for Northwind Traders, a fictitious specialty food import and export company.

Pentaho is an open source business intelligence solution fully developed in Java. It covers the entire decision chain. It therefore has the characteristics of a global coverage of the functionalities of Business Intelligence, which are the following: 
* Reporting, 
* Dashboards, 
* Ad hoc analysis, 
* Multidimensional analysis (OLAP), 
* Data integration, 
* Data Mining.

# Step by step :

### Design of the logical and dimensional diagram :
* 1 Analyze Business Drivers and Business Objectives
* 2 Identify key business processes, KPIs and any decision requests
* 3 Propose and implement a dimensional schema for the datawarehouse / datamart
* 4 Estimate the size of the datamart / datawarehouse

### Data Integration :
* 1 Extract data from the initial database
* 2 Perform the necessary transformations
* 3 Load data into the proposed datamart / datawarehouse

### Mondrian Scheme Design :
* 1 Define the dimensions
* 2 Define the measures

### MDX Querying :

### DATA Mining :
* 1 Extracting data from our Datamart
* 2 Transfer of data from csv file to arff
* 3 loading data into weka
* 4 Creating models using the decision tree
* 5 Model creation using logistic regression
* 6 Using the model on new values
